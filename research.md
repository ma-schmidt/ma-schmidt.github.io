-	Identifying Behavioral Responses in Labor Supply: Revisiting the New York Taxi Industry ([pdf]({{ site.baseurl }}/papers/taxi.pdf))

> <small>This paper presents empirical evidence that the labor supply elasticity of taxi drivers can be negative in response to temporary positive earnings shocks. The observed pattern is inconsistent with the neoclassical life-cycle model of labor supply and suggests some form of behavioral preferences. To get this result, I decompose unexpected earnings variations into a market wage component and an idiosyncratic component. This differs from previous studies that assume a homogeneous labor supply effect of unexpected earnings shocks. I identify abnormally large tips from the universe of New York medallion taxi trips in 2013 and use them as a source of exogenous variation of the idiosyncratic component. I find that the negative labor supply elasticity is only observed for the idiosyncratic component; taxi drivers respond to a positive idiosyncratic shock by decreasing their labor supply by an economically significant amount. On the other hand, a positive market wage shock causes their labor supply to increase, consistent with an optimizing rational agent. While the empirical findings of this paper rejects the neoclassical model of labor supply, they cannot distinguish between competing behavioral explanations. Therefore, three broad classes of behavioral models are compared and discussed.</small>
