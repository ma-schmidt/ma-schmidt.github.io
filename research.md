-	Identifying Behavioral Responses in Labor Supply: Revisiting the New York Taxi Industry ([pdf]({{ site.baseurl }}/papers/taxi.pdf))

<!-- <small>This paper presents empirical evidence that the labor supply elasticity of taxi drivers can be negative in response to temporary positive earnings shocks. The observed pattern is inconsistent with the neoclassical life-cycle model of labor supply and suggests some form of behavioral preferences. To get this result, I decompose unexpected earnings variations into a market wage component and an idiosyncratic component. This differs from previous studies that assume a homogeneous labor supply effect of unexpected earnings shocks. I identify abnormally large tips from the universe of New York medallion taxi trips in 2013 and use them as a source of exogenous variation of the idiosyncratic component. I find that the negative labor supply elasticity is only observed for the idiosyncratic component; taxi drivers respond to a positive idiosyncratic shock by decreasing their labor supply by an economically significant amount. On the other hand, a positive market wage shock causes their labor supply to increase, consistent with an optimizing rational agent. While the empirical findings of this paper rejects the neoclassical model of labor supply, they cannot distinguish between competing behavioral explanations. Therefore, three broad classes of behavioral models are compared and discussed.</small>

<small>This paper presents empirical evidence that the labor supply elasticity of taxi drivers has a different sign depending on the source of the earnings shocks. The observed pattern cannot be explained only by different magnitude of the income or substitution effects and is thus inconsistent with the neoclassical life-cycle model of labor supply. To get this result, I decompose unexpected earnings variations into a market-wide component and an idiosyncratic component. I use microdata on the universe of New York medallion taxi trips in 2013 to identify abnormally large tips. These large tips act as an exogenous proxy for the idiosyncratic component of the drivers' earnings. I find that a negative labor supply elasticity is observed for the idiosyncratic component; taxi drivers respond to a positive idiosyncratic shock by decreasing their labor supply by an economically significant amount. On the other hand, a positive earnings shock <i>at the market level</i> causes their labor supply to increase, consistent with an optimizing rational agent. This differs from previous studies which assume a homogeneous labor supply effect of unexpected earnings shocks. Three types of psychological factor consistent with my empirical findings are compared and discussed.</small>
