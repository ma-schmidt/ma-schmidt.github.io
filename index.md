<p class="clear-mobile">I am a Ph.D candidate in economics at the University of Toronto. 
My main research interests are in labor economics, applied microeconomics, and public economics.

<br/><br/>

I will be on the job market during the 2018-2019 academic year. I am available for interviews at the CEEE in December 2018 (Toronto) and at the ASSA meeting in January 2019 (Atlanta).
