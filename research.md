-	The Daily Labor Supply Response to Worker-Specific Earnings Shocks ([pdf - old draft]({{ site.baseurl }}/papers/taxi_schmidt.pdf))

<!-- <small>This paper presents empirical evidence that the labor supply elasticity of taxi drivers can be negative in response to temporary positive earnings shocks. The observed pattern is inconsistent with the neoclassical life-cycle model of labor supply and suggests some form of behavioral preferences. To get this result, I decompose unexpected earnings variations into a market wage component and an idiosyncratic component. This differs from previous studies that assume a homogeneous labor supply effect of unexpected earnings shocks. I identify abnormally large tips from the universe of New York medallion taxi trips in 2013 and use them as a source of exogenous variation of the idiosyncratic component. I find that the negative labor supply elasticity is only observed for the idiosyncratic component; taxi drivers respond to a positive idiosyncratic shock by decreasing their labor supply by an economically significant amount. On the other hand, a positive market wage shock causes their labor supply to increase, consistent with an optimizing rational agent. While the empirical findings of this paper rejects the neoclassical model of labor supply, they cannot distinguish between competing behavioral explanations. Therefore, three broad classes of behavioral models are compared and discussed.</small>

> <small>This paper presents empirical evidence that the daily labor supply response of workers is large and negative in response to small windfall gains (i.e. worker-specific income shocks), contrary to the prediction of the standard neoclassical model. I use microdata covering the universe of New York taxi trips to reconstruct drivers' daily work shifts in 2013. In the main specification, I identify windfall gains using tips received by drivers and find that they respond to these shocks by <i>decreasing</i> their labor supply substantially. Because tips are very common for American taxi drivers, I restrict the analysis to tips that are larger than the average but still represent a negligible part of a driver's monthly or weekly earnings. I obtain similar results when using trips from Manhattan to JFK Airport as an indicator of positive idiosyncratic earnings. I also find that these shocks do not affect future labor supply, indicating that standard neoclassical income effects cannot be causing this result. In contrast, a positive shock to average hourly earnings causes drivers' labor supply to increase, consistent with optimizing rational agency. The large and negative response to small windfall gains suggest that these shocks can have significant effects and should not be neglected when designing labor policies, especially when tips, commissions, or bonuses are involved.</small>
