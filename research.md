-	Valuing Discretionary Rest Breaks (Job Market Paper - draft coming soon)

> <small>As flexible work arrangements become increasingly prevalent in the labor market, more and more workers have discretion over when they take rest breaks. This flexibility may underscore the rapid growth of the 'gig' economy. Yet we do not know the value that workers place on the ability to <b>decide</b> when to take rest breaks, nor is there any formal economic model of the process by which a worker makes this decision. To fill the gap, I develop and estimate a behavioral model of labor supply with discretionary rest breaks. The model incorporates several factors that influence the decision to take breaks: fatigue, opportunity costs, preferences across hours of the day, and random shocks. I estimate the model using high-frequency data on millions of taxi trips covering over 15,000 drivers in NYC. For each of them, I recover the labor supply decisions of about 4,000 30-minute periods during an entire year. This allows me to characterize heterogeneity across drivers in a flexible and transparent way by estimating the model separately for each driver. Using the estimated parameters, I evaluate the welfare loss to workers if discretionary breaks are replaced by scheduled breaks. My results show that flexibility is valued highly; the average driver in my sample would require a 25 percent increase in revenue to accept a counterfactual fixed work schedule. Further, I find substantial heterogeneity in this valuation, suggesting that, for some workers, discretionary breaks bestow a large non-pecuniary benefit while others are indifferent between discretionary and scheduled breaks. I then use the model to study the effects of a realistic 'mandatory breaks' policy on the frequency of breaks and labor supply. Counterfactual evidence shows that such a policy would substantially increase the frequency of breaks but would reduce labor supply by 7 to 20 percent. This result highlights the need to weigh the benefits of break-oriented policies---including a reduction in accidents---with the negative consequences for labor supply and the welfare of workers. While I use a specific industry to estimate the model, the proposed framework is quite general and can be applied to other sectors of the labor market.</small>



-	The Daily Labor Supply Response to Worker-Specific Earnings Shocks (new draft coming soon)<!-- ([pdf - old draft]({{ site.baseurl }}/papers/taxi_schmidt.pdf)) -->

<!-- <small>This paper presents empirical evidence that the labor supply elasticity of taxi drivers can be negative in response to temporary positive earnings shocks. The observed pattern is inconsistent with the neoclassical life-cycle model of labor supply and suggests some form of behavioral preferences. To get this result, I decompose unexpected earnings variations into a market wage component and an idiosyncratic component. This differs from previous studies that assume a homogeneous labor supply effect of unexpected earnings shocks. I identify abnormally large tips from the universe of New York medallion taxi trips in 2013 and use them as a source of exogenous variation of the idiosyncratic component. I find that the negative labor supply elasticity is only observed for the idiosyncratic component; taxi drivers respond to a positive idiosyncratic shock by decreasing their labor supply by an economically significant amount. On the other hand, a positive market wage shock causes their labor supply to increase, consistent with an optimizing rational agent. While the empirical findings of this paper rejects the neoclassical model of labor supply, they cannot distinguish between competing behavioral explanations. Therefore, three broad classes of behavioral models are compared and discussed.</small>

> <small>This paper presents empirical evidence indicating that the daily labor supply response of workers in response to small windfall gains (i.e. worker-specific income shocks) is large and negative, contrary to the prediction of the standard neoclassical model. I use microdata covering the universe of New York taxi trips to reconstruct drivers' daily work shifts in 2013. In the main specification, I identify windfall gains using tips received by drivers and find that they respond to these shocks by <b>decreasing</b> their labor supply substantially. Because tips are very common for American taxi drivers, I restrict the analysis to tips that are larger than average but still represent a negligible part of a driver's monthly or weekly earnings. I obtain similar results when using trips from Manhattan to JFK Airport as an indicator of positive idiosyncratic earnings. I also find that these shocks do not affect future labor supply, indicating that standard neoclassical income effects cannot explain this result. In contrast, a positive shock to average hourly earnings causes drivers' labor supply to increase, consistent with optimizing rational agency. The large and negative response to small windfall gains suggest that they can have significant effects and should not be neglected when designing labor policies, especially when tips, commissions, or bonuses are involved.</small>
